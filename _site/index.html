        <div>
          <p>
            I help companies like yours to develop, optimize and market digital products. As a Product Strategist, I combine my experience in the domains of agile product management with those in data and marketing strategy. With these distinct skills and capabilities, I have been advising clients such as Google, Telefónica, ADAC and Decathlon for roughly 8 years now. My promise today: to think holistically about these disciplines, to bridge them, and to bring them closer together in a sustainable way - <span style="font-style: italic;">in short: tech meets business.</span><br>
            <br>
            As a freelancer, it is important for me to work closely and in a collaborative spirit with my clients and their teams. Together, we develop and test actionable levers to achieve your business goals with great products. Because our project's success should not only be visible on pretty slides, but translate into real change measured by meaningful KPI's. - <span style="font-style: italic;">in short: tech means business.</span><br>
            <br>

        <p>
          Hi, I'm Marvin.<br>
          I work with digital products & services. More precisely, I help teams to get them off the ground and into the wild.
          And I'm really glad I do. Because between creativity, technology and business is where my talents and interests are. Within and beyond nine-to-five.<br>
          It's a crazy space to work within, but it just keeps on creating those captivating challenges, surprising opportunities and rewarding moments of shared accomplishments.
