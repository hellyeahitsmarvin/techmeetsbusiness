        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I help companies like yours to develop, optimize and market digital products. As a Product Strategist, I combine my experience in the domains of agile product management with those in data and marketing strategy. With these distinct skills and capabilities, I have been advising clients such as Google, Telefónica, ADAC and Decathlon for roughly 8 years now. My promise today: to think holistically about these disciplines, to bridge them, and to bring them closer together in a sustainable way - <span style="font-style: italic;">in short: tech meets business.</span><br>
            <br>
            As a freelancer, it is important for me to work closely and in a collaborative spirit with my clients and their teams. Together, we develop and test actionable levers to achieve your business goals with great products and distribution. Because our project's success should not only be visible on pretty slides, but translate into real change measured by meaningful KPI's. - <span style="font-style: italic;">in short: tech means business.</span><br>
            <br>

        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Marvin.<br>
          for as long as I can remember, I’ve found joy and calmness in creativity –<br>
          for as long as I have worked, I’ve found pride and ambition in solving problems.<br>
          <br> 
          Building digital products and services, to me, means the best of these pursuits. I appreciate the very human, empathic aspects of working with characters and tempers just as much as I enjoy the balancing act of finding common ground along distributed teams and complex organizations. I am excited by loud and bold marketing just as much as I value the rational, calm side of research and analysis.<br>
          <br>
          Though challenging at times, I know that all decision making benefits from these different angles and new perspectives. In private as in business, it’s important to me to know where I’m going and to follow that direction with intent. With a decision made and goal in mind, progress excites me. It thrills me to see something coming to life that is created from nothing but genuine human qualities enabled by knowledge, will and technology.<br>
          <br>
          All that is why I couldn’t be happier about what I do: to help great teams getting great ideas off the ground and into the wild. It's a crazy space to work in, but it keeps on creating those captivating challenges, surprising opportunities and rewarding accomplishments.
